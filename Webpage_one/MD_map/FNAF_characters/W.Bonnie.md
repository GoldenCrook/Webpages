Withered Bonnie has an intriguing background within the Five Nights at Freddy's series. Initially, he was one of the performers at the original Freddy Fazbear's location. However, when that establishment closed down and the new Freddy Fazbear's Pizza from FNaF 2 was introduced, Withered Bonnie was decommissioned and replaced by Toy Bonnie.

Withered Bonnie is the older version of Bonnie and has a more decayed and damaged appearance compared to his original counterpart. He plays a significant role in the series, undergoing changes and reappearances throughout different games.


## Appearance:

- Withered Bonnie has a dirty, dry blue color with a lighter blue on his ears and torso.
- His face is missing, leaving a dark gap with dangling wires.
- His endoskeleton face and red/white pupils are barely visible.
- He has round, thin teeth on his bottom jaw.
- His torso is thinner than Freddy's, with a dark red bowtie and two small black buttons.
- Limbs and suit tattered, with the suit completely gone on his left foot and right hand, exposing the metal beneath.
- His left arm is missing below the shoulder pad, with wires coming out from the socket.
- Often seen leaning to one side, and his right ear is usually folded forward.

## Personality:
