Introduction:

The Classic animatronics are the first robots introduced in the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. They serve as local entertainers at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and were created by Henry Emily. These animatronics include Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Rabbit, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox. They have a simple physical appearance with fabric suits filled with crossbeams, wires, and parts that connect to the endoskeletons. They sport cartoon animal features, wear accessories like hats and bows, and have hands with four fingers and a single row of teeth on the lower jaw (except for Foxy, who has teeth on both the upper and lower jaw).

## Functionality of the Classic Animatronics:

The animatronics, including Freddy Fazbear, roam around Freddy Fazbear's Pizza in a "free-roaming mode" after hours to prevent their servos from locking up.
They mistakenly perceive the security guard, such as Mike Schmidt, as an endoskeleton without a costume, rather than a human.
The animatronics have a strict rule against employees without costumes and attempt to forcefully stuff the player into an animatronic suit as a consequence.
Survival inside the suit is not possible due to the presence of crossbeams, wires, animatronic machinery, and other mechanical structures, resulting in a fatal outcome for the player.
History of the Animatronics:

The animatronics in the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise have a dark history intertwined with paranormal events and tragic incidents:

## The Missing Children Incident:

The animatronics' homicidal tendencies are not merely the result of faulty designs and glitches, as believed by Fazbear Entertainment employees.
The animatronics are haunted by the spirits of children who were victims of the Missing Children Incident, orchestrated by William Afton, one of the company's co-founders.
The children, believed to be named Gabriel, Jeremy, Susie, Fritz, and Cassidy, were murdered by William Afton.
The cries and screams heard from the animatronics are theorized to be the voices of these tormented souls.
The Puppet and Resurrection:

The Puppet, haunted by William's first victim, Charlotte Emily, plays a crucial role in the animatronics' story.
The Puppet places the souls of the murdered children into Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and the mysterious Golden Freddy, with the intention of resurrecting them and allowing them to seek vengeance.
Blinded by rage, the souls mistake adults for William Afton and are driven to kill him.
Their ultimate goal is to have their happiest day, find peace, and ascend to the afterlife.
The haunted nature of the animatronics and their vengeful quest for justice adds a chilling and tragic element to the storyline of the Five Nights at Freddy's series.
