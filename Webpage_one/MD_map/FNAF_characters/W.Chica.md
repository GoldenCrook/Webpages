Withered Chica is the older, withered version of Chica, one of the animatronics from the Freddy Fazbear's Pizza franchise. Like the other withered animatronics, she has suffered severe disrepair and damage. After the closure of the original Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, Withered Chica was decommissioned and replaced by Toy Chica in the new establishment. However, she later went through refurbishment and became the Chica character in the first game.

Appearance:

- Dirty yellow animatronic with an orange beak and feet
- Pinkish purple eyes, permanently wide open
- Jaw stuck in an open position, revealing endoskeleton mouth and wires
- Tattered suit with missing feathers and confetti-adorned bib
- Withered arms in a T-pose, missing hands with exposed wires
- Tattered legs and orange three-toed feet

Personality:

Not much is known about Withered Chica's personality as it is not explicitly described in the game. However, like the other animatronics, she is programmed to roam the establishment at night and seek out potential customers. In her deteriorated state, she behaves aggressively and perceives the player as an endoskeleton without a suit. She will attempt to forcefully stuff them into an animatronic suit, resulting in a jumpscare.
