## #Animatronics:

Animatronics are the most prevalent robots in the franchise, appearing throughout the series.
They are designed to resemble life-like anthropomorphic creatures, including animals, humans, and even inanimate objects.
Equipped with movable limbs, voice boxes, and protective suit "armors," they are commonly used for entertainment in public establishments like restaurants.
Some animatronics, like those found in Sister Location, feature human heads designed to test facial expressions.
