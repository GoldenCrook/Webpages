the Withered animatronics are older version of the classics but left to decay after being replaced by the toy in Five nights at Freddy's 2, due to an attempted retrofit of the older animatronics that took place before they got scrapped for the newer models.

## Night Mode Behavior

- The original animatronics, before being rebuilt, do not have a designated night mode.
- Due to their construction, they were not programmed with a proper night mode functionality.
- When they don't hear noise, they believe they are in the wrong room and attempt to find a room with potential customers.
- They specifically target the Office, where either Jeremy Fitzgerald or Fritz Smith resides, depending on the night.

## Mistaken Identity

- During the night, the animatronics mistake any person they encounter as an endoskeleton without a suit.
- They assume that the person should be inside an animatronic suit and attempt to forcefully stuff them into a suit.

## Lethal Consequences

- The animatronics' intention to forcefully stuff a person into a suit results in their death.
- The process of being forcefully stuffed into a suit is fatal for the person involved.

Note: The behavior and intentions of the animatronics at night are based on their programming and their mistaken assumption about the identity of individuals encountered during after-hours.
