        <p>Foxy the pirate fox is an entertainer that's housed at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. He resides at his own separate stage in the pizzeria. He was the pirate fox entertainer when the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was opened in 1983 (however, it's unknown if he was discontinued or not).

        <ul><h3>Appearence:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Foxy is a tattered animatronic fox with crimson fur, yellow eyes, and red eyebrows.</li>
                <li>He has a hook for his right hand and a worn-down endoskeleton for his left hand.</li>
                <li>Foxy wears an eye patch that is usually positioned above his right eye, and he lacks a tail.</li>
                <li>His brown linen pants are shredded, and his exposed machinery and torn body parts indicate damage.</li>
                <li>Foxy's teeth are sharp and canine-like, with several golden teeth and possibly some missing teeth.</li>
                <li>His articulated ears can move, and his upper jaw muzzle shows signs of freckles but no whiskers.</li>

        <ul><h3>personality & Functionality:</h3>
            <li>Foxy embodies a stereotypical pirate personality, using pirate slang and speaking with a pirate accent.</li>
            <li>He may be claustrophobic, as hinted in one of his lines.</li>
            <li>Foxy is perceptive and not easily deceived, displaying awareness in game over screens.</li>
            <li>He is described as reclusive, as Freddy Fazbear sings about him rather than Foxy singing himself.</li>
            <li>Foxy's proper functioning relies on control fuses, and he malfunctions if they are absent or misplaced.</li>

        <ol><h3>In-game Behaviors:</h3>
            <li><h4>Five Nights at Freddy's 1:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Foxy starts the game in Pirate Cove, hidden behind a curtain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the player neglects to monitor Foxy frequently, his activity level increases, and he will eventually sprint down the West Hall to attack the player.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Foxy's sprint is faster than that of other animatronics, making him a significant threat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When Foxy jumpscares the player, he lunges at them with a loud screech.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Foxy's mechanics and behaviors can vary across different games in the series, including potential aggression and additional activation stages.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <small>It's important to note that Foxy's level increases with time, with an additional level being added at 3 AM and again at 4 AM.</small>
            </li>
            <li><h4>In Ultimate Custom Night:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Foxy can be found in Pirate's Cove along with Bonnie.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unlike Bonnie, it's necessary to check on Foxy in Pirate's Cove to prevent him from becoming active.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If Foxy is not monitored regularly, he will gradually emerge from Pirate's Cove and there's no way to make him go back.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Foxy has a new mechanic in Ultimate Custom Night where he can piece himself together to get into the player's office.
                        <ul><li>He will slip in chunks of himself (arms, legs, head, torso) through any open vent or door until all his fragments are inside.</li><li>Once inside, he waits for the player to pull up the monitor before putting himself back together and jumpscaring the player.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>In Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Foxy warns players to stay inside the ride and threatens to send them to "Davy Jones' locker," adding to the pirate theme.</li>
                    <li>Foxy's lines in this game sound like they are played over loudspeakers rather than directly from him.</li>
