    <article class="intro"><p>the Withered animatronics are older version of the classics but left to decay after being replaced by the toy in Five nights at Freddy's 2, due to an attempted retrofit of the older animatronics that took place before they got scrapped for the newer models.</p><p><small> The behavior and intentions of the animatronics at night are based on their programming and their mistaken assumption about the identity of individuals encountered during after-hours.</small></p></article>
